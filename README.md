# Unit-4-Game

Welcome to my Star Wars RPG game!!!

Do ever get tired of all these highly skilled Jedis and Sith Lords hogging all the glory?  
Do you ever wonder what would happen if Jar-Jar Binks fought C3P0?  
Or what that unfortunate chap who fell into the Rancor pit might have done if he got a 
shot at the poor guy who crashed into the side of the Death Star?

Well wonder no more!!!!
Battle of the Star Wars Losers is here to answer all your questions!!!!


To get started:
Choose on your character by clicking on their card.

Choose who you would like to battle by clicking on the card of one of the characters in the enemies area
and moving them to the defender area.

Press attack: your character will attack and the defender will counterattack.
Your attack will increase by its original amount on each attack.
Press attack until you or your opponent's hitpoints are zero.
If your hitpoints are below zero you lose, if your opponents hitpoints are below zero you win and can choose a new opponent.
Choose a new opponent and continue until all of your opponents are vanquished!!!!

This game was made mostly as an exercise in jQuery.  It's action and replayability is low but the character cards all move to where they are supposed to, the text refreshes properly and the attack button and the increase in attack both work as they are required.  The restart button does not work properly at this time, although it resets, it does not allow you to click on the cards to start a new game.  If you would like to see a demonstration of a winning game choose C3PO, if you would like to see a demonstration of a losing game choose anyone else.  Enjoy!
